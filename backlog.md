## To Do

- manage models constraints: event name's unicity (per company)
- add comments in .js and .css to identify html pages
- Upgrade Django and take advantage of ASGI (might come with Python and PostgreSQL version upgrades too)
- Integrate JS framework (React?)
- Add legal mentions - RGPD compliance (+ certifications)
- Closed event should be modified

- Add a company property to allow or not a user being part of more than one group  
(add property in settings + update group management accordingly)
- Use modals to create object (admin corner)
- Ability to cancel an event (status management)
- Send email for dedicated reasons such as when an event is canceled or postponed

- add a company or event level's choice field to define the label for questions / resolutions. Depending on the event's nature, property to be defined at event's level, default value could be chosen / defined at company's level )

## Done

- Implement company property to use or not groups
(define how to make it compliant with groups + allow or not access to group management + update 'import users' feature accordingly)

## Abandoned
